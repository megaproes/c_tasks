Write a function called findString() to determine if one character 
string exists inside another string.

The function should be called as follows:
	findString(source, searchString);

where:
    The first argument, source, is the character string that is to be searched.
    The second argument, searchString, is the string you are interested in finding.

If the function finds the specified string, it should return the location 
in the source string where searchString was found. 
If the function does not find searchString, it should return -1.

For example, the call:

index = findString("a chatterbox", "hat");

searches the string "a chatterbox" for the string "hat".

Since "hat" does exist inside the source string, the function 
returns 3 to indicate the starting position inside the source 
string where "hat" was found.
