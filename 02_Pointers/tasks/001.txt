Task 1: In-Place Array Rotation

1. Description: Write a function to rotate an array of integers in-place to the right by n positions. 
The array should be rotated in-place without allocating additional memory proportional 
to the size of the array (i.e., only a small constant amount of extra storage may be used).

Constraints:

    The function should handle both positive and negative values for n.
    When n is negative, rotate the array to the left by |n| positions.
    Consider potential pitfalls with memory overlap if n exceeds the array length.

Example:

    Input: arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, length = 5, n = 2

    Output: arr = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}

    Input: arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, length = 5, n = -2

    Output: arr = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}
