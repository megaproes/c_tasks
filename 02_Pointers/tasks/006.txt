Task 6: Union with Type Tracking

1. Description: Create a union to store either an integer, a float, or a pointer, 
with a type tracking field to determine what kind of data is stored. 
Write functions to set and get values from this union.

Constraints:

    Use a enum to track the type of value currently stored.
    Write functions to safely set the union value and get it based on the type.

Structure and Enum Definition:

enum DataType { INTEGER, FLOAT, POINTER, NONE };

struct DataHolder {
    enum DataType type;
    union {
        int i;
        float f;
        void *p;
    } data;
};
