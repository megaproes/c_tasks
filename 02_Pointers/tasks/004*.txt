Task 4: Dynamic Dispatcher with Function Pointers

1. Description: Write a dynamic dispatcher function that uses function pointers to 
execute a series of commands. The dispatcher should accept an array 
of function pointers along with an array of arguments, execute each 
function, and store the return values.

Constraints:

    The functions will all take a single integer argument and return an integer.
    The dispatcher should be capable of handling different functions dynamically.
    Handle possible NULL function pointers gracefully.

Example:

    Given function pointers:
        f1(int x) { return x + 10; }
        f2(int x) { return x * 2; }
    If called with commands {f1, f2}, and arguments {3, 4}, the dispatcher should return results {13, 8}.
