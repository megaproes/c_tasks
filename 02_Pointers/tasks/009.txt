9. Write a function called freeArray()

Write a function freeArray() that:

    Takes a pointer to a dynamically allocated array and frees the memory allocated to it.
    Sets the pointer to NULL after deallocation to avoid dangling pointers.

Use this function to safely free memory for any dynamically allocated array that is no longer needed.

Hint: To ensure the original pointer in the calling function is set to NULL, 
pass the address of the pointer to freeArray().
