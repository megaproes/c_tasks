7. Write a function called dynamicArray()

Write a function dynamicArray() that:

    Takes an integer n as input, representing the initial size of an array.
    Dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers with n elements using malloc().
    Initializes each element of the array with its index value (i.e., array[i] = i).

The function should return a pointer to the newly allocated array.

Note: Ensure the function handles memory allocation failure properly 
by checking if malloc() returns NULL, and returning NULL if allocation fails.
