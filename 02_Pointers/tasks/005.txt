Task 5: Flexible Array Member in a Struct

1. Description: Write a function that allocates memory for a struct with a 
flexible array member and initializes its values. The structure should 
contain a fixed-size integer field and a flexible array of integers.

Constraints:

    The function should allocate enough memory for n flexible array elements.
    Handle potential allocation failures gracefully.

Structure Definition:

struct FlexArray {
    int count;
    int values[];
};

Example:

    Input: n = 3, values {5, 10, 15}
    Output: A dynamically allocated struct with count = 3 and values = {5, 10, 15}.
